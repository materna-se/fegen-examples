# FeGen Examples

The directory `fegen-example-gradle` contains an example project that demonstrates how FeGen can be used to generate Typescript and Kotlin code based on a Spring application that simplifies using the REST API provided by Spring.

The sub projects `kotlin-api` and `web-api` also contain tests for the code generated by FeGen.
If you checked out the `fegen-examples` project as part of the `fegen` repository and want to test the changes you made to FeGen, comment in the following line in `settings.gradle`:

```
includeBuild '..'
```

There is also a maven example in `fegen-example-maven` demonstrating how to include FeGen in a maven project.
However, if you are interested in examples of the generated code being used, you should refer to the gradle example as it is far more complete.
